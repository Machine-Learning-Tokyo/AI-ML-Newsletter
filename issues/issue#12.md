# The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI)

Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the European Union*, have joined together to create the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI or Gee-Pay). Founding members will support the responsible and human-centric development and use of AI in a manner consistent with human rights, fundamental freedoms, and our shared democratic values, as elaborated in the OECD Recommendation on AI.

The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) is an international and multistakeholder initiative to guide the responsible development and use of AI, grounded in human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation, and economic growth.

# NeurIPS 2020 fully virtual

Following other ML conferences such as ICLR 2020 and ICML 2020 that were held online this year due to the global COVID-19 development, NeurIPS 2020 will be held as a fully virtual conference this year as well. Registration pricing will be significantly reduced and there will be no late registration charges or caps on registration.
