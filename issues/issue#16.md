# M2M-100 — multilingual machine translation

- Facebook AI introduced the first multilangual machine translation model — M2M-100

- The model can translate between any pair of 100 languages without relying on English data

- The team open-sourced the model, training and evaluation set up.

# TensorSensor

- TensorSensor is a library that clarifies exceptions by augmenting messages and visualizing Python code to indicate the shape of tensor variables.

- TensorSensor works with TensorFlow, PyTorch, Numpy as well as higher-level libraries like Keras and fastai.

```
import tsensor
import numpy as np

W = np.random.rand(764, 100)  # This should be (100, 674) which would rise an exception
b = np.random.rand(100, 1)
X = np.random.rand(200, 764) 

with tsensor.clarify():
    Y = W @ X.T + b
```
