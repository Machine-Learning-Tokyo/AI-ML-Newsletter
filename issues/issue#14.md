# Real World Reinforcement Learning (RWRL) simulation suite
- Existing RL benchmarks do not capture many of the challenges found in applied systems and products. Introducing the Real-World RL(RWRL) simulation suite, developed to accelerate research on these challenges

- The RWRL suite is a set of simulated tasks inspired by applied reinforcement learning challenges, the goal of which is to enable fast algorithmic iterations for both researchers and practitioners, without having to run slow, expensive experiments on real-systems. 

- RWRL supports a subset of the DeepMind Control Suite domains, but the goal is to broaden the suite to support an even more diverse domain set.

# Google offers career certificates equivalent to 4-year degree

- Google announced three new online certificate programs in data analytics, project management and user experience design. Google says that the certificates are the equivalent to a four-year degree and classes will be taught by Google employees themselves.

- The courses will be offered by Coursera. The courses will take about six months to complete and the certificates will be “remarkably affordable” compared to a traditional four-year university.

- Scholarships will be offered to those who qualify for financial aid.
