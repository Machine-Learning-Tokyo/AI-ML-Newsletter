# AlphaFold: a solution to a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology

- The latest version of AlphaFold (AlphaFold-2) has been recognised as a solution to one of biology's grand challenges - the “protein folding problem”. 

- It was validated at CASP14, the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction

- We’re excited about the potential impact AlphaFold may have on the future of biological research and scientific discovery.

# NeurIPS Meetup Japan 2020

- NeurIPS is one of the top conference for Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience

- NeurIPS Meetup is a local event hosted during the NeurIPS conference, leveraging conference videos and live local content, with a duration ranging from a few hours to a full week, and bringing together participants from one or more companies, universities, and/or the public. 

- NeurIPS Meetup Japan will take place this year on December. 

- The NeurIPS Meetup is organizers by RIKEN AIP, MLT, Keio University, University of Tokyo, Tokyo Institute of Technology, NTT and MathWorks Japan.

# Grad SLAM

- gradslam is a PyTorch based open-source framework providing differentiable building blocks for SLAM systems.

- SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it. 

- SLAM algorithms are used in navigation, robotic mapping and odometry for virtual reality or augmented reality.
